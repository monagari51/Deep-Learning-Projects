## House Price Prediction by using Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
1. Task involved predicting whether the house price is above or below the median value.
2. Created and trained Artificial Neural Network(ANN) by using Keras, tuned the model with the best parameters. 
3. Performed L2 regularization to reduce overfitting of the model. Achieved accuracy of 88.13% with the ANN model.

### Technologies:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Keras
4. Matplotlib and Searborn
